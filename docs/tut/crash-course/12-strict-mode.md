# Strict Mode

While developing UI with Vide, you should use Vide's strict mode, which can
be set with `vide.strict = true` once when you first require Vide. Strict mode
will add extra safety checks and emit better error traces, particularly when
errors occur in property bindings.

A full list of what strict mode will do can be found
[here](../../api/strict-mode).
